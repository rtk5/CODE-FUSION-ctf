#### Challenge Description:
In "Insanity Check," you’re faced with a maze of misleading websites and buttons, designed to throw you off track. This challenge tests patience and attention to detail as you navigate through multiple pages, most of which are distractions. Your goal is to discover the hidden flag, broken into three parts and embedded within the HTML comments of three specific websites. Each of these sites—named "jogi," "project1," and "calc"—contains a part of the flag, while the other pages are red herrings meant to irritate and mislead.

#### Hints:
1. Pay close attention to the HTML comments on each website you visit.
2. Only three websites contain useful information for the flag; the rest are distractions.
3. Be prepared for some humorous and misleading detours!

#### Files Attached: -> None (only a website link is provided)

## Steps to Solve:

1. **Explore the Websites**: Start by clicking on different buttons on the main website. Some buttons will redirect you to various pages, while others may open pop-ups or lead to irrelevant websites.
   
2. **Look for the Right Websites**: After a few attempts, you'll identify that the websites "jogi," "project1," and "calc" are unique. Inspect these pages closely, ignoring any misleading information on other pages.

3. **Inspect HTML Comments**: Once on each correct website, open the developer tools (typically by pressing `F12` or right-clicking and selecting "Inspect"). Look through the HTML comments (`<!-- ... -->`) for parts of the flag.

4. **Piece Together the Flag**: Collect the three parts of the flag found within the comments of each of the sites—"jogi," "project1," and "calc." Combine them in the correct order to reveal the complete flag.

#### Flag Format: 
`FLAG-RAID{3423Dhuva4r4-3nieri39asked-235nkejME-rknTO-4DRIVE-U-MAD}`

#### Additional Notes:
Be patient—this challenge is meant to test your perseverance and ability to sift through irrelevant details. Remember, only three specific websites contain useful clues, and the rest are distractions.
